`RS` is an R package that implements classes for R. 

It is centered around *type validation* of attributes, 
so you can be confident your classes contain the right data.

Despite the cost of providing type validation, 
it is about *700-800% faster* than the next fastest OOP package.

The name `RS` is a combination of:

- The R and S languages (S is R's predecessor).
- `.rs` - the file extension used for Rust files, and the TLD of Rust websites.


## Install

Any of the following should work:

```R
pak::pak("avhz/RS")
## or
renv::install("avhz/RS")
## or
devtools::install_github("avhz/RS")
```

This installs the latest development version of `RS` from GitHub. 
`RS` is not yet on CRAN, but hopefully will be soon.

## Usage

```{r}
library(RS)

Class(
    "Dog",
 
    # Fields
    name  := t_char,
    age   := t_int,
    breed := t_char,
 
    # Methods
    bark := function(.self) cat(.self@name, "goes woof!\n")
)
 
fluffy <- Dog(name = "Fluffy", age = 3L, breed = "Golden Retriever")
```

Note that the fields are special objects like `t_int`, `t_char`, etc.
These objects allow for attribute type validation.

If you pass an incorrect type for one of the fields, you will get an error like:

```R
fluffy <- Dog(name = 1, age = 3L, breed = "Golden Retriever")
"Invalid type <'double'> passed for field <'name'>."
```

```{r}
fluffy@name
fluffy@age
fluffy@breed
fluffy@bark()
```

I used the slot operator `@` for accessing attributes in `RS`, because the common `$` operator
is so pervasive in R code that I wanted an operator that made
it more obvious that the object is an `RS` class,
rather than a list, dataframe, environment, R6 class, etc.

> Instead, composition is supported and preferred.

## Benchmarks

> See the [Benchmarks vignette](https://avhz.github.io/RS/articles/Benchmarks.html) for benchmark code.

The following shows the iterations per second for class instances for a number of R OOP libraries.

You can see that `RS` offers at least a 7-8x performance gain over the other offerings.

> Note #1: the other libraries may provide more features and are currently more mature/complete offerings, in particular `R6`.

> Note #2: creating Python class instances via `reticulate` inside the R interpreter is *significantly* slower than doing it directly in Python.
> Python classes are still much, much faster than my `RS` package (~30-40x faster when I last checked).
